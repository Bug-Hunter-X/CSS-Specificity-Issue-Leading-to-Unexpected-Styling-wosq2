This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue related to specificity.  A more specific selector is unintentionally overridden by a less specific one because of the order in which styles are defined. The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The solution prioritizes specificity and ensures that styles are applied as intended.
